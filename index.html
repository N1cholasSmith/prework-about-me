    <section class="details">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 29 years old and I'm a Mechanical Aircraft Technician in the Royal Australian Navy </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Brisbane however due to being a member of the defence force I currenlty live in Nowra, NSW</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Snowboarding is my favourite hobbie however I do a lot of research into innovative technologies. I find the amount of technolgies able to have such a tremendous impact now extremely exciting, especially when I invest into their vision and gain a lot of value for a relatively small amount of time invested. Therefore I find it is the most rewarding thing I can do for my time, which is why i'm so passionate about it.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This is a really interesting question I ask myself a lot actually. Since I started investing into innovative technologies I've always wanted financial freedom to have the option of doing whatever I wanted, which was to travel. The realisation that i could have financial freedom by the end of next year really made me think about not being involved in the exciting innovative technologies sector, this is why i had to change my goal as I would love to be an ambassador for Constellation Network and sell enterprises and governments on their HGTP (Hypergraph Transfer Protocol) limitless infrastructure that I am so passionate about because I know it will change economies and enterprises like never before. This gets me excitied and excercises my passion so I would be proud to and would enjoy that as a job. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live on the beautiful South Coast of NSW</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I wanted to start up skilling myself into a more technical aspect whilst being able to improve my personal company. This is only the begining for me as I would love to start programing applications and explore into Fintech. This seemed like a perfect option to learn a new core skill which is transferrable into other aspects im interested in</p>
